# The CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 and DoH-DGA-Malware-Traffic-HKD combined dataset

* The dataset (CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020-and-DoH-DGA-Malware-Traffic-HKD.zip) is available on the Hokkaido University website - https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2115/86574.

* The "l1-total-malware.csv" contains traffic flows of Non-DoH 897493 and DoH 24019.

* The "l2-total-malware.csv" includes traffic flows of Normal DoH 19807 and Suspicious DoH 4212.

* The "l3-malware.csv" encloses traffic flows of PadCrypt 840, Sisron 744, Tinba 1808, and Zloader 820.

* Note that the file size of the "l3-malware.csv" in this dataset is smaller than the one in the original dataset as a result of being saved by Microsoft Excel. For example, the first FlowBytesSent value is represented as 43859 in this data set, while it is 43859.0000000000 in the original data set.
